### Function Code:
```solidity
function flashLoan(
    address receiverAddress,
    address[] calldata assets,
    uint256[] calldata amounts,
    uint256[] calldata modes,
    address onBehalfOf,
    bytes calldata params,
    uint16 referralCode
) external override nonReentrant {
    // Code omitted for brevity...
    address receiver = receiverAddress;
    bytes memory params = abi.encode(assets, amounts, modes, onBehalfOf, params, referralCode);
    // Code omitted for brevity...
}
```
Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method: `abi.encode`

Explanation

Purpose
The `flashLoan` function in the Aave LendingPool contract allows users to borrow funds without providing collateral, as long as the borrowed amount plus fees are returned within the same transaction. This function is widely used for arbitrage, refinancing, or executing complex financial strategies that require large sums of capital for a short period.

Detailed Usage
The `abi.encode` method is used within the flashLoan function to encode multiple parameters into a single `bytes` array. Specifically, it encodes the arrays of assets, amounts, modes, the address on behalf of which the loan is taken, additional parameters, and a referral code.

This encoding serves two primary purposes:

1- Simplification: By encoding multiple parameters into a single `bytes` array, the function simplifies the handling and passing of these parameters, making the overall logic more manageable.
2- Flexibility: The encoded `params` can be easily passed around, stored, and later decoded as needed. This is particularly useful for flash loans, which often involve complex operations that require dynamic parameter passing.

Impact
The `abi.encode` method's usage in the `flashLoan` function significantly contributes to the contract's functionality by enabling dynamic and flexible handling of multiple parameters. It allows the Aave protocol to offer sophisticated flash loan services, facilitating advanced DeFi strategies and improving liquidity efficiency in the ecosystem. By efficiently encoding and passing parameters, it enhances the modularity and maintainability of the contract, supporting Aave's position as a leading DeFi protocol.
